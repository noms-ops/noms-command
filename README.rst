====

**NOTE:** This is the *roadmap* for a second-generation of the 'noms' general purpose interface. It is a target for implementation and very much subject to change, and also none of it exists.

**noms** is a remote command-line interface interpreter. It's designed to be a stable runtime environment for interpreting server-defined command-line interfaces for (principally) rest-like data stores (or for commands that are side-effect free, but *not* commands that change any state on the system on which the command runs).

The web browser is a platform in which the operator of a web service can implement a graphical user interface to data it controls. For example, it's a common pattern to offer access to services and data via a ReST or ReST-like interface, making http requests against a remote API understanding the HTTP verbs and returning results in the form of HTTP responses, header metadata and response bodies containing serialized data (e.g. JSON). Such interfaces are generally implemented in a combination of HTML documents and Javascript which modifies the document model of the HTML page(s).

**noms** enables an author to offer a command-line interface designed along the same pattern: structured documents modified by javascript programs, interpreted and rendered on the client. **noms** has sandboxing similar to web browsers (no modifying of local storage outside of restricted, application-specific local storage and automatic caching of javascript files).

**noms** is *not* a web browser and is not designed to offer terminal user interfaces like lynx or elinks. It is also *not* an interactive shell--it's designed to be used from a shell. It maintains authenticated sessions state when necessary.

Syntax
------

The basic way of invoking an **noms** command is as follows::

  noms *url* *options* *arguments*

**noms** invokes the app at *url* with the given options and arguments, displaying the results.

Special URLs
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Certain invalid "URLs" are interpreted specially:

* ``noms login *url*``

Normally **noms** handles user authentication implicitly. With this command, it does a HEAD request against the application URL, forcing login if required.

* ``noms logout *url*``

Causes **noms** to forget its session state for the given application URL.

* ``noms *bookmark*[/arg] ...``

The **noms** command itself has a configuration file (``~/.noms``, ``/usr/local/etc/noms.conf``, ``/etc/noms.conf`` in that order) which defines bookmarks to different URLs. For example, given the following in ``/etc/noms.conf``::

  { 
    "cmdb": "https://cmdb.noms-example.com/cmdb.json",
    "instance": "https://ncc-api.noms-example.com/ncc-api.json",
    "nagios": "https://nagios.noms-example.com/nagui.json",
    "nag": "https://nagios.noms-exmaple.com/nagui.json"
  }

When invoked in the following ways, it's the equivalent to the command on the right:

================================= ==================================================================
Command given                     Equivalent command
================================= ==================================================================
``noms cmdb query fqdn~^m00``     ``noms https://cmdb.noms-example.com/cmdb.json query fqdn~^m00``
                                  (``document.argv[0]`` set to ``cmdb``)
``noms cmdb/env list``            ``noms https://cmdb.noms-example.com/cmdb.json list``
                                  (``document.argv[0]`` set to ``cmdb/env``)
``noms nag alerts``               ``noms https://cmdb.noms-example.com/nagui.json alerts``
                                  (``document.argv[0]`` set to ``nag``)
================================= ==================================================================

Implementation
--------------

If the type is ``text/plain``, it's simply displayed.

If the type is a recognized data serialization format (JSON or YAML):

* application/json
* application/x-json
* text/json
* application/yaml
* application/x-yaml
* text/yaml

If the fetched content is a single object and the object has the top-level key '$doctype', it may be interpreted according to "Dynamic Doctypes", below. Otherwise, it is assumed to be either a single object to display or a list of such. Otherwise **noms** will render the object or array using its default format (usually YAML).

Dynamic Doctypes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The principle dynamic doctype is the ``noms-v2``, which is an object with the following top-level attributes:

``$doctype``
  Must be ``noms-v2``. In future, backwards-incompatible extensions may be implemented in ``noms-v3`` or higher doctypes.

``$script``
  An ordered array of scripts to fetch and evaluate.

``$argv``

``$exitcode``

``$body``
  The body of the document is the data to display. See `Output Description Notation`_ below.

From the perspective of javascript executing within the application, these are accessible as properties of the
global **document** object.

Output Description Notation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following entities are allowed in the body of a **noms-v2** document.

* Arrays - Each item in the array is concatenated with a line-break between them.
* Strings and numbers - A string or number is just displayed
* Raw objects - Raw objects are rendered using **noms** default formatting (usually YAML)
* Described objects - Described objects are data along with information on how to render them. A described object
  has a top-level attribute called **$type** which defines how the described object is rendered.

  * ``$type``: **object-list** An object list is a (usually) tabular list of objects with information on how
    wide to make the fields or how to otherwise serialize the objects. It has the following attributes:

    * **render**: The format in which to render, one of: **json**, **yaml**, **text** (default **text**)
    * **fields**: Field names, headings and widths
    * **objects**: The objects to render

  * ``$type``: **object** An object described-object has the following attributes:

    * **render**: The format in which to render, one of: **json**, **yaml**, **text** (default **yaml**)
    * **object**: The object data

Invoked scripts have access to the following global objects:

* **window** - This has information about the terminal environment in which **noms** is being invoked. It has the following attributes:
  * **height** - Height (if known)
  * **width**  - Width (if known)
  * **isatty** - true if the output stream is a terminal
  * **document** - The document global object
* **document** - The document object is the current document being rendered by **noms**. In addition to the attributes of the document itself, it has the following:
  * **argv** - The arguments being invoked. The first element of this array is the first argument passed to **noms** itself (not the script it ultimately fetches, but how it's invoked, similar to ``$1``
  * **exitcode** - The numeric exit code with which **noms** will exit. Initially 0.

Question
--------

How much formatting should **noms** do? Web pages do a lot of formatting, and the Javascript influences it. So I was going to have
a relatively rich formatting language (above). Now I'm wondering if maybe the body of the page should just be text, and the scripts are free to do with it what they will. In effect--have no 'special' formatting. No, it's probably better to at least have a default and not have to write formatting code for every case.

Web 1.0 vs Web 2.0
------------------

Like the "real web", **noms** commands can choose to do some calculation on the server and some on the client: **noms** doesn't care. You can use no ``$script`` tag at all and just calculate the entire document to be rendered in the client (though this currently odoesn't allow for argument interpretation, in the future the arguments may be passed in request headers or **noms** may allow a way for them to show up in a query string or POST request--but **noms** is not really a command-line http client either). This is up to the application designer.

Possible Future Features
------------------------

Streaming: provide a way to have a streaming pipeline between data fetched by scripts in a "page" and the output stream of the **noms** command.
